## How I Built It

I tackled the club entry task by diving into web scraping with Go, thanks to a super chill YouTube tutorial on __[Web Scraping using Go lang]__. The video was a lifesaver—without it, I’d probably still be staring at my screen in confusion!

I also checked out a website that gave me the scoop on adding time delays (because who likes getting blocked, right?).

### Steps I Took:
1. Watched the YouTube video and thought, "Hey, this seems easy!"
2. Checked out a website to learn how to slow things down a bit (not everything has to be a race).
3. Wrote the code as per the tutorial (with a sprinkle of my own flair).
4. Tested it out and, lo and behold, it worked like a charm!
